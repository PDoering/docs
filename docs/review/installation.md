# Installation

You can download the most recent version from [our website](https://assets.retest.org/releases/review.html). Afterwards, you can use your preferred data compression software to open the file and unzip it to a place of your choice.

## Open on Windows

Simply open the executable `review.exe` application.

### File Association on Windows

Add *review* to your start applications and get a local test report. Right click on it and go to `Open with` and search for the `review.exe`. Now all future test reports should be easy to open via *review* just by clicking on them.

## Open on Mac and Linux

Open the executable `review` shell file and you are good to go.

## Login / Connect to rehub

Upon opening review your browser should pop up, redirecting you to [*rehub*](https://garkbit.prod.cloud.retest.org/dashboard) to login and connect your account. If you click on `Open...` in *review* and you don't see your reports from *rehub*, but can only search for local reports, the login either did not work or you got logged out. You can open the menu on the burger icon in the top left corner and click on `Open Account...`. If you've logged in there, reopen *review* and your reports should appear.

## Updating review

If you have an old version of *review* but updated *recheck* and *recheck-web* the application will not work anymore. The versions have to match in order to work correctly. To update *review* you have to download the new version on our website and reinstall it.
