# Ignore

## Hide Ignored Elements

In the top left corner of the test report, above the navigation for the differences is a box with check marks for different type of elements. By using them you automatically ignore all elements of that type. Below that box is another check mark to filter every accepted/ignored (green) elements from the navigation tree.

## Revert Ignores

If you accidently or intentionally ignored an element you now want to track for differences, you can go to the `Ignored Elements` page from the burger menu in the top left corner. This page will only work when you open the report locally out of the matching project folder, that also contains the `recheck.ignore` file. You can either download the test report from *rehub* or go to the location that is shown when you click in the head bar in review, and move it to your project folder.
